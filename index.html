                    <summary>When did coffee first appear in Ireland?</summary>
                    <p>If we take a look back at European coffee beginnings in the early 17th century, where coffee was first being imported into Europe by Venetian traders, Ireland was actually quite late to the party. Whilst coffee houses began to spread across Europe as “third place” establishments, it wasn’t until the very end of the of 17th century that coffeehouses were introduced to the Irish public with the first opening of a Dublin coffee shop. Throughout the 18th century, coffee trend spread into country towns across Ireland with coffee houses opening in Cork, Limerick, Kilkenny, Wexford, Galway and later into Belfast and Waterford.
